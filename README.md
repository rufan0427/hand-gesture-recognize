In fact, the repository includes the codes for data collection process and some OpenCV manners to work with the raw images.

Chinese habits for number gestures are disparate from the Western's. This recognizer is designed for the **Chinese** number gestures and thanks for the dataset provider [daocunyang](https://github.com/daocunyang/Chinese-Number-Gestures-Recognition)

For the hand-number-gesture-recognize usage,the only codes that are necessary to be downloaded are **identify_stream.py ,keypoint_gesture_recognizer.pth_ and _hand_landmarker.task** .
As long as you have installed mediapipe,torch and other essential packages, just run ```python identify_stream.py``` and have fun with it.
